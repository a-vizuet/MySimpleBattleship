# MySimpleBattleship
A simple battleship that I had to program in just two hours.

There's some thing I have to modify.
* What happens when the users knows who wins.
* Fix stuff with turns, specifically about saying whose turn.

And there's also stuff I want to add.
* Make it distribuited.
* Make draggable ships.
* Add images, sounds... make it beautiful.
